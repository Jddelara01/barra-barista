            Our Story goes back around 2019, to our founder Vincent Regidor. Armed with a passion for coffee, he had a
            vision to change peopleâ€™s perspective of coffee in Mindanao. He wanted to change the coffee culture and
            would serve very high quality coffee and serve as neighbourhood meeting spots.
         <br>   
            We started off simply trying to make a simple local independent coffee house work in Barra, Dipolog City.
            And it did! We never aspired to be a big company. We have grown one coffee, one customer and one store at a
            time.
